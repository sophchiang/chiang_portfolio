		<h1>Usability Study</h1>
			<h2>Method: The website I had to the people test was my web portfolio. The target audience is teenagers in highschools. The task I assigned to them is to test if they can access my graphics page and see if the images show up, see if they can get the clock to show up on the javascript page, and to check if they can get the message pop up show up in the javascript page.</h2>
			<h2>Results: The subjects were able to complete the tasks I assigned them. They were able to complete the tasks quickly.</h2>
			<h2>Discussion: I learned that I should fix my divs because it is not aligned correctly. I also discovered that I need to fix my link to my javascript page because not all of my other pages link to the javascript page.</h2>
